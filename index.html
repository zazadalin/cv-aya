            As a teenager, model scouts drew attention to me, and soon I made my
            debut on the podium and in front of camera lenses, shooting for
            advertising certain brands. While living in Almaty, I collaborated
            with the EAT Models agency. The modeling business fascinated me so
            much that as soon as I turned 16, I wanted to leave my native
            country for Paris or Milan and develop a career as a model there,
            because everyone around me predicted a great future for me in this
            industry.

          <p class="experience__text-2">
            Everything turned out differently: I gradually became interested in
            design, and soon I created my own brand of clothing in the style of
            minimalism "ASH". Modeling activity has moved to the background and
            has become one of my favorite hobbies. Already living in France, I
            participated in various shoots for glossy magazines. And once even
            appeared on the cover of the fashion magazine "ZUT!"
